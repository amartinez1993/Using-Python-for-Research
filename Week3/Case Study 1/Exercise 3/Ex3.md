### Exercise 3

alphabet and positions have already been defined from previous exercises. Use positions to create an encoded message based on message where each character in message has been shifted forward by 1 position, as defined by positions. Note that you can ensure the result remains within 0-26 using result % 27
Store this as encoded_message.
