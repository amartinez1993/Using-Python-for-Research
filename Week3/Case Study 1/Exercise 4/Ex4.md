### Exercise 4

alphabet, position and message remain defined from previous exercises. In addition, sample code for the previous exercise is provided below. Modify this code to define a function encoding that takes a message as input as well as an int encryption key key to encode a message with the Caesar cipher by shifting each letter in message by key positions.
Your function should return a string consisting of these encoded letters.
Use encode to encode message using key = 3, and save the result as encoded_message.
Print encoded_message.
