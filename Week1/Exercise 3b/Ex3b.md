### Exercise 3b

Compute and store R=1000 random values from 0-1 as x.
moving_window_average(x, n_neighbors) is pre-loaded into memory from 3a. Compute the moving window average for x for values of n_neighbors ranging from 1 to 9 inclusive.
Store x as well as each of these averages as consecutive lists in a list called Y.
