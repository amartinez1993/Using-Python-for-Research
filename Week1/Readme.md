## Week 1

### Exercise 1

In this five-part exercise, we will count the frequency of each letter in a given string.

### Exercise 2

Consider a circle enclosed by a square. The ratio of their areas is pi / 4. In this six-part exercise, we will find a way to approximate this value.

### Exercise 3

A list of numbers can be very unsmooth, meaning very high numbers can be right next to very low numbers. This list may represent a smooth path in reality that is masked with random noise (for example, satellite trajectories with inaccurate transmission). One way to smooth the values in the list is to replace each value with the average of each value's neighbors, including the value itself.
