### Exercise 2

Create a function place(board, player, position), where:
player is the current player (an integer 1 or 2)
position a tuple of length 2 specifying a desired location to place their marker.
Your function should only allow the current player to place a marker on the board (change the board position to their number) if that position is empty (zero).
Use create_board() to store a board as board, and use place to have Player 1 place a marker on location (0, 0).
