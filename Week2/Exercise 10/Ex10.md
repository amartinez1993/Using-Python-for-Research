### Exercise 10

create_board(), random_place(board, player), and evaluate(board) have been created from previous exercises. Create a function play_game() that:
Creates a board.
Alternates taking turns between two players (beginning with Player 1), placing a marker during each turn.
Evaluates the board for a winner after each placement.
Continues the game until one player wins (returning 1 or 2 to reflect the winning player), or the game is a draw (returning -1).
Call play_game once.
