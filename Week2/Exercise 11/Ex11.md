### Exercise 11

Use the play_game() function to play 1,000 random games, where Player 1 always goes first.
Import and use the time library to call the time() function both before and after playing all 1,000 games.
Store these times as start and stop, respectively.
Subtract them to evaluate how long it takes to play 1,000 games, and print your answer.
The library matplotlib.pyplot has already been stored as plt. Use plt.hist() and plt.show() to plot a histogram of the results.
Does Player 1 win more than Player 2?
Does either player win more than each player draws?
