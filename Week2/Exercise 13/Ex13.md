### Exercise 13

The results from Exercise 12 have been stored. Use the play_strategic_game() function to play 1,000 random games.
Use the time libary to evaluate how long all these games takes.
The library matplotlib.pyplot has already been stored as plt. Use plt.hist and plt.show to plot your results. Did Player 1's performance improve? Does either player win more than each player draws?
