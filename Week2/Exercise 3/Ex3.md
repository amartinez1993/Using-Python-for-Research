### Exercise 3

Create a function possibilities(board) that returns a list of all positions (tuples) on the board that are not occupied (0). (Hint: numpy.where is a handy function that returns a list of indices that meet a condition.)
board is already defined from previous exercises. Call possibilities(board) to see what it returns!
